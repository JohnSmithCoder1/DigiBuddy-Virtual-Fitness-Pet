What if your fitness tracker actually cared if you showed up today?

DigiBuddy turns your daily steps and exercise into care for a virtual pet who depends on you. Your steps are their walks. Your workouts are their playtime. It's the fun, motivating layer that transforms activity tracking from something you forget into something you genuinely look forward to every day.

Why you’ll love DigiBuddy:
* A fitness buddy who needs you — Your digi reacts to your real-world activity, celebrating your wins and gently letting you know when they need more care
* Gamified goals made personal — Set your own step and exercise targets, earn Happy Days when you hit them, and level up your digi with Happy Day streaks
* Seamless Apple Health sync — Automatically track activity from your iPhone or Apple Watch, or log manually for more control
* Smart, supportive notifications — Friendly reminders that automatically stop once you’ve already hit your goals for the day
* Encouragement over pressure — DigiBuddy is built for motivation and consistency. Every day is a fresh start, and your digi is always rooting for you.

If you struggle to stay consistent, lose interest in other fitness apps after a week, or just need that extra push most days — your digi is waiting.

Download DigiBuddy now and start building habits that last.
